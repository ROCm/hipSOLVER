# hipSOLVER
hipSOLVER is a LAPACK marshalling library, with multiple supported backends.  It sits between the application and a 'worker' LAPACK library, marshalling inputs into the backend library and marshalling results back to the application.  hipSOLVER exports an interface that does not require the client to change, regardless of the chosen backend.  Currently, hipSOLVER supports [rocSOLVER](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocSOLVER) and [cuSOLVER](https://developer.nvidia.com/cusolver) as backends.

## Installing pre-built packages
Download pre-built packages either from [ROCm's package servers](https://rocm.github.io/install.html#installing-from-amd-rocm-repositories) or by clicking the github releases tab and manually downloading, which could be newer.  Release notes are available for each release on the releases tab.
* `sudo apt update && sudo apt install hipsolver`

## Quickstart hipSOLVER build

#### Bash helper build script (Ubuntu only)
The root of this repository has a helper bash script `install.sh` to build and install hipSOLVER on Ubuntu with a single command.  It does not take a lot of options and hard-codes configuration that can be specified through invoking cmake directly, but it's a great way to get started quickly and can serve as an example of how to build/install.  A few commands in the script need sudo access, so it may prompt you for a password.
*  `./install -h` -- shows help
*  `./install -id` -- build library, build dependencies and install (-d flag only needs to be passed once on a system)
