# Change Log for hipSOLVER

Full documentation for hipSOLVER is available at the [hipSOLVER Documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipSOLVER/en/latest/index.html).

## (Unreleased) hipSOLVER
### Added
- Added functions
  - auxiliary
    - hipsolverSetDeterministicMode, hipsolverGetDeterministicMode

### Optimized
### Changed
- Binaries in debug builds no longer have a "-d" suffix.
- Changed rocSPARSE and SuiteSparse to be run-time dependencies by default. The `BUILD_WITH_SPARSE` CMake option can still be used
  to convert them into build-time dependencies (now off by default).
- The --no-sparse option of the install script now only affects the hipSOLVER clients and their dependency on hipSPARSE. Use the
  `BUILD_HIPSPARSE_TESTS` CMake option to enable tests for the hipsolverSp API (on by default).

### Deprecated
- The Fortran bindings provided in `hipsolver_module.f90` have been deprecated.
  The Fortran bindings provided by the hipfort project are recommended instead.

### Removed
### Fixed
### Known Issues
### Security
