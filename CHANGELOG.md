Full documentation for hipSOLVER is available at the [hipSOLVER Documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipSOLVER/en/latest/index.html).

## (Unreleased) hipSOLVER

### Added
* Added compatibility-only functions
  * csrlsvqr
    * hipsolverSpScsrlsvqr, hipsolverSpDcsrlsvqr, hipsolverSpCcsrlsvqr, hipsolverSpZcsrlsvqr

### Changed
### Removed
### Optimized
### Resolved issues
### Known issues
### Upcoming changes


## hipSOLVER 2.3.0 for ROCm 6.3.0

### Added

* Added functions:
  * auxiliary
    * hipsolverSetDeterministicMode, hipsolverGetDeterministicMode
* Added compatibility-only functions:
  * potrf
    * hipsolverDnXpotrf_bufferSize
    * hipsolverDnXpotrf
  * potrs
    * hipsolverDnXpotrs
  * geqrf
    * hipsolverDnXgeqrf_bufferSize
    * hipsolverDnXgeqrf

### Changed

* Binaries in debug builds no longer have a "-d" suffix.
* Changed rocSPARSE and SuiteSparse to be run-time dependencies by default. The `BUILD_WITH_SPARSE` CMake option can still be used
  to convert them into build-time dependencies (now off by default).
* The `--no-sparse` option of the install script now only affects the hipSOLVER clients and their dependency on hipSPARSE. Use the
  `BUILD_HIPSPARSE_TESTS` CMake option to enable tests for the hipsolverSp API (on by default).

### Upcoming changes

* The Fortran bindings provided in `hipsolver_module.f90` have been deprecated.
  The Fortran bindings provided by the hipfort project are recommended instead.


## hipSOLVER 2.2.0 for ROCm 6.2.0
