=======================================

**Contents**

hipSOLVER's documentation consists of 3 main chapters. The User Guide is the starting point for new
users of the library, and a basic reference for current users. For a list of currently implemented
routines in the regular API, see the hipSOLVER API chapter. As explained in the User Guide, hipSOLVER
also has an API that is fully compatible with cuSOLVER, described in the hipSOLVER Compatibility
API document.
