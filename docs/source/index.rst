**Contents**

hipSOLVER's documentation consists of 3 main Chapters. The User Guide is the starting point for new 
users of the library, and a basic reference for current users. For a list of currently implemented 
routines in the regular API, see the hipSOLVER API chapter. As explained in the User Guide, hipSOLVER 
also has an API that is fully compatible with cuSOLVER; it is described in the hipSOLVER Compatibility
